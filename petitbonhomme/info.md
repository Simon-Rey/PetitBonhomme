<h1>About this Project</h1>

This project came about from reflecting on my wardrobe: what goes in, what goes out, what is worn, and what isn’t.
This reflection occurred at a time when my wardrobe was evolving rapidly.
It marked the period when I began wearing clothes societally considered feminine.
It was a complete shift in my clothing habits: I was purchasing a lot of items to fill a newly prominent gap in my
wardrobe.
After a few frenetic months, I began to question what I was actually wearing and how much money I was spending
on items I barely worn.
I started logging my outfits, and, in parallel, developing this website.

The aim of *Le Petit Bonhomme Simon* is to provide me with objective tools to analyze my wardrobe.
It emphasizes the notion of price-per-wear—the idea that one should invest in clothing items proportionally to
their frequency of use.
The more frequently worn an item is, the more reasonable it is to spend a larger amount on it.
Conversely, expensive items that are rarely worn (suits, wedding dresses, etc.) should be allocated less.

This website offers an accurate representation of what I wear and own (sometimes to the best of my memory).
It’s open-source, and the code and the data can be found on this
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Simon-Rey/PetitBonhomme).
Have fun exploring!

PS: If you’re curious about the name of this website, here’s a little story.
When I was a kid my parents and I had a ritual. 
Every evening we would create the so-called "Petit Bonhomme Simon", a smaller version of myself.
The idea was to lay down on the floor the clothes I would wear the next day, in the shape of sticky figure. 
This website is the modern version of that ritual.
